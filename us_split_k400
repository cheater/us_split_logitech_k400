// NAME
//
// us_split_k400
// an xkb keyboard layout
//
//
// ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
//
// A keyboard layout for xkb. Geared specifically towards reducing RSI, this
// layout is nearly identical to US-QWERTY, except there is a two-key split
// between the T and Y columns into which symbols from the furthest right of
// each row are placed. The hands can assume a more natural position two key
// columns wider apart (similarly as with Dvorak) and hitting Enter is not an
// exercise for contortionists any longer.
//
// One of the problems with US-QWERTY is that the palm of the right hand needs
// to move a lot -- especially bending in the wrist -- which can then lead to
// Repetitive Strain Injury. If you spend a lot of time typing, you should be
// aware of this, and should know that you might be hurting yourself with an
// inappropriate keyboard layout. This layout makes it easy for people to try
// out something new while mitigating many important issues.
//
// The changes can be seen easily at the diagrams below:
//
// Normal US-QWERTY:
//
//     Caps F1 ... F12
//
//      ` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = BBBB
//     Tab q w e r t y u i o p [ ] RRR
//     Esc  a s d f g h j k l ; ' \ RR
//     SSS < z x c v b n m , . / SSSSS
//     CCC W AAA __________ AA RC CCCC
//
//
// This layout:
//
//     Caps F1 ... F12
//
//      ` 1 2 3 4 5 - = 6 7 8 9 0 BBBB
//     Tab q w e r t [ ] y u i o p RRR
//     Esc  a s d f g \ ' h j k l ; RR
//     SSS B z x c v , . b n m / SSSSS
//     CCC W Alt __________ AA RC CCCC
//
// The symbol keys, which do not get typed very often, have been placed in the
// middle. This is analogous to them being out of the reach of the right hand in
// its normal position on the US QWERTY keyboard, except that this time they are
// accessed using the much more dexterous index finger. Additionally, they are
// shared with the left index finger, which as a practical outcome means that
// the palms of the hand need to travel less and can in fact stay in their home
// position most of the time, as most keys can be accessed by reaching out the
// fingers. Additionally, this action of reaching out the fingers is completely
// opposite to the movements that cause RSI, and stretches the muscle and
// ligaments that get damaged by non-ergonomic layouts.
//
// The symbol keys have been moved because in the US QWERTY layout they increase
// the distance the right palm needs to travel in order for the typist to press
// Backspace and Enter, which are very important and frequently typed keys. As
// it is, the US QWERTY layout develops a habit in its users where they jerk the
// palm of the right hand to the right after every finished sentence, creating a
// very fast pathway towards RSI. There have been attempts to solve the problem
// by using smaller keys for the right-hand-side symbols, as well as by making
// the enter key bigger. Some of them have been partly successful, however none
// of them was fixing the problem at its source, which is an inadequate layout.
//
// The key between the left Shift and z is the 105th key. It exists on many
// European keyboards and some people love it, while others hate it with
// passion. The author has been a member of both groups. It is mapped as a
// second Backspace.
//
// Caps Lock is placed where Esc was and Esc is placed where Caps Lock was. This
// is hardcoded for now, but might be configurable in the future.
//
// Naturally, this layout can be used in conjunction with GNOME's keyboard
// layout options in order to turn the Caps Lock key into another Escape,
// Control, or Meta key.
//
//
// INSTALLATION
//
// In order to install the layout in Ubuntu 10.04 and similar operating systems,
// use the included install.py script which will complete the whole process. You
// might need to execute it as a superuser. The installer should work in newer
// Ubuntu versions, as well. However, it has not been tested with KDE or Unity,
// and might not work in them. This version has only been tested with GNOME and
// Ubuntu 10.04. Installation usually completes without restarting the X server.
//
// In order to install on other systems, you might need to change the options of
// the installer. See ./install.py --help for a description of the options. For
// example, the xkb directory might have moved. You would search for a directory
// called "xkb" with the subdirectories "rules" and "symbols", among others. You
// might also need to change the name of the xml file. Normally, rules/evdev.xml
// is used on Ubuntu 10.04, but it might be rules/xfree86.xml, rules/base.xml,
// or rules/xorg.xml.
//
// On some systems, lst files with the same base names are used instead of xml
// files. Those files are not supported by the installer, however editing them
// by hand is fairly easy; in the !layout section you would add the line:
//
//         us_split_k400  USA Split (Logitech k400)
//
// Next, you should copy the us_split_k400 file into the "symbols" subdirectory
// of the xkb directory. A restart of your X server might now be required. That
// should be all that is necessary; this installation procedure has, however,
// not been tested.
//
//
// USAGE
//
// In order to use the layout, if you are in GNOME you would use the program
// gnome-keyboard-properties(1) which can normally be accessed in the System
// menu, Preferences submenu. Alternatively, it can be started from a terminal.
//
// Once the Keyboard Properties are visible, you would select the Layouts tab,
// where you would then click the Add button and navigate to the By Language
// tab. In this tab, select English as the language and then find USA Split in
// the Variants dropdown. Finally, click Add. You can then select the layout
// from the list.
//
//
// STABILITY
//
// The layout may change (even drastically!) in the future. Older versions
// should be available from the usual sources.
